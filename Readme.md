# Swing GUI Sudoku

Comes with session saving/reloading, fault hinting, code-configurable difficulty and a backtracking solver.

Cool thing about this is that the code itself allows for arbitrary-sized and configured grids, 
but the GUI does not expose this.

There are menu options and key combinations for all of the options.

See the [Releases](https://github.com/tamchow/gui-sudoku/releases) page for more info (especially on how to run this).
